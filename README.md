# Browser Tab Lagger / Crasher
This simple script in a .html file will lag or even crash your browser tab or your entire browser!
# How does this work?
This works by adding a browser history entry (like Crashsafari), a message log in the console and a new text on the webpage too, it does this multiple times and at speed of one millisecond. In simple terms, it basically overloads the browser with nonsense.
# The code sucks. Learn to do better scripts!
No shit!

It's supposed to be like this. Like, what did you expect? Its purpose is to overload a browser tab. I can't believe i genuinely had to add this explanation, this code got some criticism for literally doing whatever it's supposed to do.
# Why would someone ever need something like this?
uhh..
